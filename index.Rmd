I am a [postdoctoral fellow](https://bsse.ethz.ch/people/detail-person.MzQxNDg4.TGlzdC8yNjY5LC0xMDExNjczNjI=.html) at the [Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering](https://bsse.ethz.ch/), [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/). 
I am also an affiliated researcher at the [ETH AI Center](https://ai.ethz.ch/) and the [SIB Swiss Institute For Bioinformatics](https://www.sib.swiss/) 

Before I came to ETH, I had the pleasure to work with [Laust Hvas Mortensen](https://en.rockwoolfonden.dk/employees/laust-hvas-mortensen/), [SÃ¸ren Brunak](https://www.cpr.ku.dk/staff/?pure=en/persons/6656) and several other excellent researchers at [Denmark Statistik](https://www.dst.dk/en) and the [University of Copenhagen](https://www.ku.dk/en).
During my Ph.D. at [Cambridge University](https://www.cam.ac.uk/) and [EMBL-EBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/), I worked with [Moritz Gerstung](https://www.dkfz.de/mitarbeiter/moritz-gerstung) and [Ewan Birney](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/people/person/ewan-birney/).
I received my MSc. in Statistics from [Edinburgh University](https://www.ed.ac.uk/) and my BSc. in Economics from [University of Bamberg](https://www.uni-bamberg.de/).

A current CV is available [here](CV_Jung.pdf).

My research interest center around **survival and event history** analysis with a particular focus on method development and applications to electronic health records (EHR) 
 More recently, I have been working on **generative AI** and **causal inference** - you may find a more detailed expose in [Research](research.html). 

If you are interest to discuss or collaborate on a problem in this direction, don't hesitate to contact me by [email](contact.html).
